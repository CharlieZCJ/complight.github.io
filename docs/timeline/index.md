We presented two invited talks at [SPIE's Photonics West](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west?SSO=1). Our first talk is on [Perceptually guided computer-generated holography](https://spie.org/photonics-west/presentation/Perceptually-guided-computer-generated-holography/12024-4?SSO=1), and our second talk is on [Beaming Displays: Towards Displayless Augmented Reality Near-eye Displays](https://spie.org/photonics-west/presentation/Beaming-Displays-Towards-Displayless-Augmented-Reality-Near-eye-Displays/12019-3).

We thank the next byte podcast for covering [our collaboration on SensiCut project with MIT](https://t.co/ymdm9KTsUN).
They did a great job in explaining our in their podcast.

</div>
Our invited work, "Learned Holographic Light Transport", is published at [Optica's Applied Optics](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.439401). We show that light transport can be made more accurate by learning hardware dependent kernels.

</div>
We are grateful to the Royal Society for awarding us with their [research grants 2021 round two scheme](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/research-grants/). Their award will enable us to invent new holographic light transport models in the future. This is award is worth `14994.65 GBP`. The title of our submission is `Learned models for Computer-Generated Holography`.
