</div>
Our invited work, "Learned Holographic Light Transport", is published at [Optica's Applied Optics](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.439401). We show that light transport can be made more accurate by learning hardware dependent kernels.

We are grateful to the Royal Society for awarding us with their [research grants 2021 round two scheme](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/research-grants/). Their award will enable us to invent new holographic light transport models in the future. This is award is worth `14994.65 GBP`. The title of our submission is `Learned models for Computer-Generated Holography`.
