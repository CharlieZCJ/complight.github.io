- You maintain public software or hardware related projects that are part of your previous research. 
- You have helped organize events in your research field or participated in exciting venues where you demonstrated your work in public to other people.
- You publish at highly reputable top-tier conferences or journals that are relevant to our laboratory's work. Here are some examples of these conferences and journals: ACM SIGGRAPH, ACM SIGCHI, ACM UIST, IEEE VR, IEEE ISMAR, Optica Optica, Optica Optics Express, Nature Photonics, Nature Light or alike.
