# Welcome message
Welcome aboard!

**The computational light laboratory conducts research and development in light sciences, including computer-generated holography, computer graphics, computational imaging, computational displays and visual perception.**

**Our core mission is to show our societies that there can be better services, experiences, and goods that serve the benefits of humanity by using light.**
We are here to invent the next in light-based techniques and unlock the mystery of light.

We build [our tools](https://github.com/kunguz/odak) to perform work and invent new methods to improve state of the art. 
Most importantly, we document [our steps](https://complight.github.io/documentation) so that the others can follow.
Finally, we release our work to the public on our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/complight). 
We have multiple social media outlets to promote our work. 
These include our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/complightlab), our LinkedIn account, our YouTube account and [our webpage](https://complight.github.io/). 
We don't shy away from going public and participate in public demonstrations with our prototypes.

# Getting aboard!
In the rest of this documentation, you will find a checklist that will help you establish yourself as a member of the Computational light laboratory.
There is also an additional subsection that provides a list of suggestions to help you get you to establish collaborative work ethics.
Note that this and the other documents that you will find on this website are always subject to change.
In fact, as a member, please do not hesitate to suggest improvements and be the change by actually having a pull request in the [source repository](https://github.com/complight/complight.github.io).

## Checklist

## Suggestions
These are some suggestions to help you get establishing yourself as a collaborative member of the group.

 - Install software that helps you send emails. With that software, make sure you can schedule emails. Please do not send emails to people you don't know well outside 8 am to 6 pm (unless they are in a different time zone).

- Life brings many challenges, and not all days are sunny. Even if communication degrades over time, keep the kindness. Control yourself. Never say anything that you will regret! (Life is not war)

- We are all collaborators. The best things happen when people collaborate. Being a Swiss knife is good, but there isn't a leader in history that leads no one. There was no human on this planet can exist by themself.

- Avoid unnecessary communication, leave others room to organize themselves.

- If you are angry, stand up and walk. Take a break, be somewhere else for some time. When it is time, and you are calm, come back.

- Smile, stand up, walk, be kind and love yourself, and respect yourself.

- **Know yourself!**

- Spend time to understand things if you want to be an expert in the topic. Do not worry about how much it takes, but worry if you don't understand.

- You will be exposed to noise most of the time in your communications. Improve your filters to extract useful information.

- Do it now if you can. Tomorrow will arrive with new tasks.

- The work is not complete until it is complete. Don't be handwavy. Ensure that you provide a working solution (not an "it can work easily in the next step" solution).

- Research impact means the beneficial application of expertise, knowledge, analysis or discovery. It can also be described as an effect on change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life beyond academia.

- Build it. They will come.
