# Welcome

**You have reached the website for the Computational light laboratory.**

The computational light laboratory is a part of [Computer Science Department](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).
The computational light laboratory is lead by [Kaan Akşit](https://kaanaksit.com).

**Our core mission is to show our societies that there can be better services, experiences, and goods that serve the benefits of humanity by using light.**
We are here to invent the next in light-based techniques and unlock the mystery of light.

The computational light laboratory conducts [research and development](../publications) in light sciences, including computer-generated holography, computer graphics, computational imaging, computational displays and visual perception.
Our primary software toolkit to tackle our research problem is public and open-source.
We published our toolkit as [Odak](https://github.com/kunguz/odak) in GitHub.
We translate our scientific output to actual [lecture modules](../teaching), and we create [useful documentation](../documentation) for our research and development.
These are all public as we trust in people!
