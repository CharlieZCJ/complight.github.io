## Our Research Focus
The computational light laboratory conducts [research and development](../publications) in light related sciences, including computer-generated holography, computer graphics, computational imaging, computational displays and visual perception.
We share our scientific output in the form of [published articles and papers](https://complightlab.com/publications/).
Our primary software toolkit to tackle our research problems is public and open-source.
We host our toolkit as [Odak](https://github.com/kunguz/odak) in GitHub.
We translate our scientific output to actual [lecture modules](../teaching), and we create [useful documentation](../documentation) for our research and development.

To read more about our recent activities, please visit our [recent timeline](../timeline).
Our research focus in terms of applications is depicted in the below conceptual figure.
