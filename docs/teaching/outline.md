# COMP0160 Perception and Interfaces


## Visual perception and its applications in graphics and displays
**Summary:** 
This lecture focuses on human visual perception and its applications in computer graphics and computational display domains.
In this course, the students will learn about a simplified geometric raytracing method used in computer graphics and optical sciences.
Using this raytracing component, students of this class will get a chance to understand how light rays are sensed by a human observer viewing a three-dimensional scene.
Towards the end of this lecture, students will build a simplified optical simulation of the human visual system.
Using this simulation model, the students will adequately understand how three-dimensional vision works, how our eyes focus on different parts of a scene, and how we perceive parts of a scene at the foveal and peripheral regions of a visual system.

**Chapters:**

- Basic introduction to visual perception and its biology (20 minutes).
- Basic geometric raytracing (20 minutes).
- Modeling simplified binocular visual system using raytracing (20 minutes).
- Visual, colour and depth acuity (20 minutes).
- Brief description of ventral processing (20 minutes).
- Case studies in computer graphics and computational displays (20 minutes).
