# COMP0160: Perception and interfaces

## Summary
"COMP0160: Perception and interfaces course" offers students a gateway to get familiar with various aspects of perception. Greater details of the course and its broad description can be found in [course website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/perception-and-interfaces-COMP0160).

Computational light laboratory contributes to `COMP0160: Perception and Interfaces` by providing two lectures introducing the human visual system, its relation with graphics and displays, and sensing modalities in emerging devices (e.g., near-eye displays).
Each of these lectures is two hours long. In addition, we support these lectures with laboratory assignments for the students, which are vital for completing the course.

## Lecture 2: Visual perception in graphics and displays

:material-calendar: Winter 2022
:octicons-location-16: [Online](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/)


This lecture focuses on human visual perception and its applications in computer graphics and computational display domains.
??? Details
    **Summary:**
    In this course, the students will learn about a simplified geometric raytracing method used in computer graphics and optical sciences.
    Using this raytracing component, students of this class will get a chance to understand how light rays are sensed by a human observer viewing a three-dimensional scene.
    Towards the end of this lecture, students will build a simplified optical simulation of the human visual system.
    Using this simulation model, the students will adequately understand how three-dimensional vision works, how our eyes focus on different parts of a scene, and how we perceive parts of a scene at the foveal and peripheral regions of a visual system.

**Chapters:**

- Basic introduction to visual perception and its biology (20 minutes).
- Basic geometric raytracing (20 minutes).
- Modeling simplified binocular visual system using raytracing (20 minutes).
- Visual, colour and depth acuity (20 minutes).
- Brief description of ventral processing (20 minutes).
- Case studies in computer graphics and computational displays (20 minutes).
