# COMP0160: Perception and interfaces

## Summary
**COMP0160: Perception and interfaces course** offers students a gateway to get familiar with various aspects of perception. Greater details of the course and its broad description can be found in [course website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/perception-and-interfaces-COMP0160).

Computational light laboratory contributes to `COMP0160: Perception and Interfaces` by providing two lectures introducing the human visual system, its relation with graphics and displays, and sensing modalities in emerging devices (e.g., near-eye displays for virtual reality and augmented reality).
Each of these lectures is two hours long. In addition, we support these lectures with laboratory assignments for the students, which are vital for completing the course.

## Timetable
The timetable provided below show parts of COMP0160 that are provided by computational light laboratory.

This lecture focuses on human visual perception and its applications in computer graphics and computational display domains.
??? Details
    **Summary:**
    The students will learn about human visual perception in this course.
    They will primarily learn about the eye and its structure.
    The information about the eye explained throughout the lecture will be linked to designing computational displays and perceptual graphics with real cases from the recent literature.
    Towards the end of this lecture, students will have enough information to build a simplified optical model of a human eye.
    They will be encouraged to build an eye model using this simplified optical simulation of the human eye.
