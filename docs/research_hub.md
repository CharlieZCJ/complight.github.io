We started a public Slack group dedicated to scientists researching computer graphics, human visual perception, computational photography and computational displays. We aim to build a single hub for everyone and provide all members with a gateway to:

- meet others in the field,
- find collaborators worldwide,
- introduce open-source tools for research,
- announce and plan events in major conferences (e.g., SIGGRAPH, CVPR, IEEE VR, SPIE PW),
- advertise opportunities for others (e.g., internships, jobs, initiatives, grants),
- promote their most recent research,
- find subjects for their experiments,

But most of all, the primary goal is to stay connected to sustain a healthy research field. To join our Slack channel and contribute to future conversations, please use the provided below link:

Please do not hesitate to share the invitation link with other people in your field.
